# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview of `Iris_Flower_classification.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, using their sepal and petal dimensions. It demonstrates a complete data science workflow, including loading, cleaning, visualizing, and modeling the data.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Importing Libraries**
   - Utilizes `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn` libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

2. **Data Loading**
   - Reads the Iris dataset from a CSV file (`IRIS.csv`) into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Displays a preview of the dataset using `df.head()`.

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Explores missing values and ensures data consistency.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizes feature relationships and class distributions using:
     - Pair plots
     - Heatmaps
   - Tools used: `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

5. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
   - Ensures the data is ready for model training.

6. **Model Training**
   - Implements a Logistic Regression model to classify the Iris species.
   - Uses scikit-learn for training and validation.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluates the model using metrics like:
     - Confusion matrix
     - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

8. **Conclusion**
   - Summarizes model performance and suggests further steps for improvement.

## Dataset Details

The dataset (`IRIS.csv`) contains 150 samples evenly distributed across three classes:

- **Features**:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- **Target Variable**: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

### Dataset Characteristics
- No missing values.
- Well-balanced classes.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Install required libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn
     ```

2. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Iris_Flower_classification.ipynb`.

3. **Execute Cells Sequentially:**
   - Follow the notebook structure, executing cells in order for smooth reproducibility.

## Purpose of the Notebook
